# What To Watch (WTW) ðŸ“š

## Introduction
WTW is an application designed to help you manage your manga reading lists, allowing you to track mangas you have read or plan to read. The app also lets you compare your lists and ratings with those of your friends. Developed as a final project for our course, WTW was created using Kotlin. Although the course primarily focused on Java, we challenged ourselves to use Kotlin for the entire project to learn a new language and enhance our programming skills.

## Features ðŸŽ¯

### List Management
- **Organize Your Mangas**: Easily create and manage custom lists of mangas you plan to read or have already finished. You can also assign ratings to each manga to keep track of your opinions.

### Friend Comparison
- **Compare with Friends**: Import a list of your friends and compare your manga ratings with theirs. Discover new mangas that your friends have read but you havenâ€™t explored yet.

## Project Status
WTW was developed as a final course project. There are no current plans for further development, as the primary goal was to learn and apply new skills.
